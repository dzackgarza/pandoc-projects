# Valid Document Test

This is a completely valid Markdown document.

## Section 1

It includes:

- Lists
- **Bold text**
- _Italic text_

## Section 2

A simple paragraph here.

```python
# A code block
def hello():
  print("Hello, world!")
```

And even a bit of inline LaTeX that should be fine: $E=mc^2$.
